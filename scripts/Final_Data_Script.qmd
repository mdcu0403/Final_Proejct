# Common Work

## Loading Packages

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(rio)
library(knitr)
```

## Loading and Renaming the dataset

```{r}
# Load the file
file_path <- here("data", "hints6_public.rda")
load(file_path)

# Change the file name to 'hints'
hints <- public
```

# RQ1. What is the distribution of demographic/socio-economic categories, including age, gender, ethnicity, education, and income level, among individuals who do and do not use Telehealth services?

## RQ1_1. Data Cleaning

```{r}
#this is for Nishat's work

# RQ2. How do social media usage frequency and health information engagement levels on social media (low, medium, high) differ between individuals who use and do not use Telehealth services?
